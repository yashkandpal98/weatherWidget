This is a simple template weather widget created using QML in QT Creator.
Only basic shapes (rectangles) have been used along with simple Parallel & Sequential animations.
The widget is designed to cycle through 3 weather scenarios (clear, frosty and hot) in respective places. No real-time data is used.
On  the bottom-right corner, local time and date is displayed.
Weather states are changed upon mouse click.
